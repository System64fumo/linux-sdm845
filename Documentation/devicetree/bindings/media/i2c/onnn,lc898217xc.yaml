title: ON Semiconductor LC898217XC Voice Coil Motor (VCM) Lens

maintainers:
  - Vasiliy Doylov <nekocwd@mainlining.org>

description:
  The LC898217XC is a 11-bit digital-to-analog (DAC) converter.
  VCM current is controlled with a linear mode driver.The DAC is controlled
  via a 2-wire (I2C-compatible) serial interface that operates at clock
  rates up to 1MHz. This chip integrates Advanced Actuator Control (AAC)
  technology and is intended for driving voice coil lenses in camera modules.
